3.	Traditional programming may have limited formal testing and focuses on immediate functionality, while software engineering prioritizes comprehensive quality assurance with various testing types and automated tools for continuous integration.
4.	Traditional programming is typically done by individuals or small, independent teams with informal collaboration, while software engineering requires coordinated efforts among diverse teams using tools and practices for effective communication and alignment.
5.	Traditional programming often delivers functional solutions without extensive planning for future changes, whereas software engineering designs software for ongoing maintenance and scalability, using modular design and version control for long-term viability.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

The SDLC is a structured process that guides the development of software through a series of well-defined stages.
1.	Requirements Gathering and Analysis: collecting detailed requirements from stakeholders to understand what the software needs to accomplish. It includes defining functional and non-functional requirements, performing feasibility studies, and creating a Requirements Specification Document (RSD).
2.	System Design: high-level system architecture and detailed design are created based on the requirements gathered. It involves creating design documents, data models, and system architecture diagrams to provide a blueprint for development.
3.	Implementation (Coding): The actual code is written during this phase. Developers build the software components based on the design documents, following coding standards and best practices. This phase results in executable software modules.
4.	Testing: verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. It includes various levels of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. The goal is to identify and fix bugs.
5.	Deployment: The software is deployed to the production environment during this phase. It includes activities such as installation, configuration, and data migration. The goal is to make the software available for use by the end-users.
6.	Maintenance: Once the software is in use, this phase involves providing ongoing support, fixing any issues that arise, and implementing updates or enhancements. Maintenance ensures that the software continues to function properly and adapts to changing user needs.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Key Differences:
1.	Development Approach: Agile uses iterative cycles with frequent releases and flexibility for changes, while Waterfall follows a sequential, linear process with each phase completed before the next begins, making changes difficult once a phase is done.
2.	Project Planning and Requirements: Agile involves continuous planning and evolving requirements with regular stakeholder input, whereas Waterfall requires detailed upfront planning and documentation with a fixed scope that resists changes during development.
3.	Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile is highly adaptable, allowing rapid responses to new requirements and feedback, while Waterfall is inflexible to changes once development starts, adhering strictly to the initial plan.
4.	Testing and Quality Assurance: Agile integrates testing throughout the development process for early defect detection, while Waterfall conducts testing only after the development phase, leading to late defect discovery that can be costly to fix.
5.	Documentation and Process: Agile prioritizes working software over comprehensive documentation and adapts processes as needed, whereas Waterfall emphasizes detailed documentation at each stage and follows a rigid, predefined process.
Scenarios where one may be preferred:
1.	Agile Model
-	Best for projects where requirements are expected to change frequently.
-	Ideal for projects requiring frequent user feedback and iterations, such as web applications or startups.
-	Effective in projects with high levels of uncertainty or new technology.
2.	Waterfall Model
-	Suited for projects with stable and well-understood requirements that are unlikely to change.
-	Preferred in industries that require rigorous documentation and compliance, such as healthcare or aerospace.
-	Works well when the project has a fixed budget and strict timelines, as it provides a clear scope and schedule.


Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements Engineering is a systematic process for identifying, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system, ensuring that these requirements align with stakeholder needs and are effectively managed throughout the SDLC.
1.	Process of Requirements Engineering
-	Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders using techniques like interviews and surveys.
-	Analysis: Refining and prioritizing these requirements to resolve ambiguities and conflicts.
-	Specification: Documenting detailed, clear requirements in a Requirements Specification Document (RSD).
-	Validation: Ensuring that requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and are feasible through reviews and prototyping.
-	Management: Continuously tracking and updating requirements to reflect changes and maintain alignment with project goals.
2.	Importance
-	Requirements provide the foundation for all subsequent development activities as hey guide the design, coding, and testing processes, ensuring the final product meets user needs and expectations.
-	Proper requirements engineering helps identify potential issues and ambiguities early in the project which reduces the risk of costly changes, scope creep, and project failures by clarifying what the system should do.
-	Clearly defined requirements lead to higher quality software that meets stakeholder expectations. 
-	Requirements serve as a communication tool between stakeholders and the development team.
-	Ensuring the final product meets the specified requirements leads to higher customer satisfaction.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design refers to dividing a system into self-contained, independent units called modules, each encapsulating a specific functionality and interacting through well-defined interfaces.
1.	How Modularity Improves Maintainability
-	Simplifies Debugging and Testing: Modularity allows individual modules to be tested and debugged independently, making it easier to identify and fix issues without affecting the entire system.
-	Facilitates Updates and Enhancements: Updating or adding features to a module can be done without impacting other parts of the system, reducing the risk of introducing new bugs.
2.	How Modularity Enhances Scalability
-	Promotes Efficient Resource Utilization: Modules can be allocated resources according to their specific needs, ensuring efficient use and avoiding contention.
-	Allows Incremental Scaling: New modules can be added to extend functionality or improve performance without requiring an overhaul of the existing system.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Software testing encompasses several levels, each serving a specific purpose in ensuring the quality and functionality of a software application:
1.	Unit Testing verifies individual components or modules in isolation to ensure they function correctly and handle various inputs and edge cases properly.
2.	Integration Testing tests the interaction between integrated components to validate their combined functionality, detecting issues such as data flow problems or interface mismatches.
3.	System Testing evaluates the complete software system in its operational environment to validate its overall behavior, performance, and compliance with specified requirements.
4.	Acceptance Testing assesses the software from the end user's perspective to determine if it meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
Why it’s crucial:
-	Reduces Costs and Risks: Early defect detection reduces the cost and complexity of fixing issues later in the development process, minimizing project risks and delays.
-	Builds Stakeholder Confidence: Comprehensive testing instills confidence in stakeholders that the software will perform effectively in production, enhancing trust in the development process.
-	Validates Functionality: Testing confirms that the software functions as intended, delivering the expected outcomes and meeting user requirements.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version Control Systems are tools that manage changes to source code, documents, and other files in software development projects. They track modifications, facilitate collaboration among team members, and enable developers to revert to previous versions or merge different versions of files.
Importance
-	Collaboration: VCS enables multiple developers to work concurrently on the same project without conflicts, by managing merges and ensuring consistent code integration.
-	Backup and Recovery: VCS acts as a backup by storing previous versions of files in a repository, providing a safety net in case of data loss or accidental changes.
Examples
-	Git: Has distributed version control system, supports branching and merging, lightweight and fast, decentralized, extensive community support, integrations with CI/CD tools e.g., GitHub, Jenkins, GitLab CI.
